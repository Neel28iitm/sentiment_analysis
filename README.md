Sentiment Analysis on Rotten Tomatoes Movie Reviews ðŸŽ¬ðŸ“Š

I recently worked on sentiment analysis using the Rotten Tomatoes dataset, experimenting with both machine learning and deep learning models. Hereâ€™s how the results stacked up:

âœ… Traditional Machine Learning Models:

Decision Tree Classifier: 79% accuracy
Random Forest Classifier: 80% accuracy (best among ML models)
âœ… Transformer-based Models:

RoBERTa (Representative Model): Matched Random Forest with 80% accuracy.
FLAN-T5-Base (Generative Model): Achieved a significant boost with 89% accuracy!
This highlights the power of generative models like FLAN-T5 in NLP tasks, especially for text classification and sentiment analysis. ðŸš€
